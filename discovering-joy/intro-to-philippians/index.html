	<div id="a" class="b">Philippians has been given the moniker <b>"the epistle of joy"</b> throughout church history. In a book comprised of just 4 chapters, χαρά <b>(joy)</b>, χαίρω <b>(rejoice)</b>, and συγχαίρω <b>(rejoice together)</b> occur 16 times. Hence, Johann Albrecht Bengel, an 18th century New Testament scholar who composed one of the most renowned editions of the Greek New Testament, had this to say about Philippians</div>
	<div class="b c f">The summation of the epistle is, <b>"I rejoice, rejoice!"</b></div>
	<div class="b c">In our exploration of the Spiritual fruit of joy, we will be using Philippians as an anchor text, so it is important to understand how to read Philippians with a focus on this theme.</div>
	<div class="d">3 SECTIONS</div>
	<div class="b">Philippians can be divided into 3 sections (note that these sections are not contiguous)</div>
	<div class="b e" style="margin-top: 20px"><b>1.</b> 1:1-3:1a, 4:4-9, 4:21-23</div>
	<div class="b e"><b>2.</b> 3:1b-4:1</div>
	<div class="b e"><b>3.</b> 4:10-20</div>
	<div class="b" style="margin-top:20px">DISCLAIMER: This 3-part structure is not a rhetorical framework for understanding the book of Philippians. In fact, it actually comes from a viewpoint that gained some popularity amongst scholars in the 1960s that the book of Philippians is not a single letter but the composition of 3 separate letters. This theory has been and still is contested, and many scholars hold to the traditional view that Phillipians is a single letter.</div>
	<div class="b c">I am using these divisions because the bulk of Paul's commentary on Joy is in section 1. Therefore, we will largely be ignoring sections 2-3.</div>
	<div class="d">SETTING</div>
	<div class="b">We know that Paul writes Philippians while in imprisonment (1:7), and most historians place the letter during Paul's 2nd Roman imprisonment. What is notable when it comes to Joy is that Paul during this imprisonment knew that his end was near.</div>
	<div class="b c">Given this remarkable fact, we will now define Joy to mean such:</div>
	<div class="b c f" style="font-style: normal"><b>Joy</b> is the outward expression of an innermost <i>hope</i> and gives <i>love</i> its <i>endurance</i>.</div>
	<div style="margin: 40px; text-align: center;">- - -</div>
	<div class="b f"><b>Love</b> does not <b>rejoice</b> at wrongdoing, but <b>rejoices</b> with the truth. <b>Love</b> bears all things, believes all things, <b>hopes</b> all things, <b>endures</b> all things. (1 Cor 13:6-7, ESV)</div>
	<div class="d">CHEAP JOY</div>
	<div class="b">It is worth noting that across all generations and all cultures, both inside and outside the Church, there are always blindspots in our ability to understand the nature of God. That is to be expected. After all, "we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away," (1 Cor 13:9-10, ESV) and "the perfect" has not yet come.</div>
	<div class="b c">That being said, I think there is one idea of Joy that we must prevent our own Flesh from wanting to be true. It is something I call "cheap joy."</div>
	<div class="b c">When Jesus brought Joy to the World, he did not hoist Israel into a perpetual state of peace and prosperity. As a matter of fact, Christians both in the early church and today often undergo great persecution, and it is actually in the very environments where this persecution is most prevalent that the Gospel spreads most fervently.</div>
	<div class="b c">Point being, Joy is often far removed from comfort. By "comfort", I am not speaking of comfort from the Spirit in times of grief, nor am I talking about an embarrassment of riches. Rather, I am talking about many of the things we wish for day-after-day: financial stability, good health, no catastrophic accidents, etc.</div>
	<div class="b c">Before I continue, it is probably worth squashing the idea that I believe anything listed above is a bad thing to desire. The last thing I want to do is glorify some masochistic view of Joy that embraces suffering and hardship.</div>
	<div class="b c">However, my point is actually a very simple one. The more we desire and even attain comfort in life, the more ammo the Enemy has to launch the same attack that worked in the Garden—the temptation to believe that we know what's best for us more than God does.</div>
	<div class="d">CONCLUSION</div>
	<div class="b">Joy must transcend anything in life that can be taken away, and it must also outweigh the depth and breadth of suffering that exists in this fallen world. After all, we know that Christ went to the cross joyfully.</div>
