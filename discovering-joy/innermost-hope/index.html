<body>
	<div id="a" class="b">Hope is inseparable from Joy. That is because Joy comes in two flavors:</div>
	<div class="b e" style="margin-top: 20px"><b>1.</b> Joy in anticipation of hope</div>
	<div class="b e"><b>2.</b> Joy in fulfillment of hope</div>
	<div class="b" style="margin-top: 20px">We can see both in the opening of Philippians.</div>
	<div class="b c f">In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. (Phil 1:4-6, NIV)</div>
	<div class="b c">On the one hand, Paul rejoices in a hope that has already been fulfilled, namely, the steadfast faith and support of his brethren in Philippi since the start of his ministry, <i>your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now</i>. On the other, Paul rejoices in a hope for something he anticipates, <i>that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus</i>.</div>
	<div class="g">REFLECTION</div>
	<div class="b"><i>You will be sharing your answers later on in the night</i></div>
	<div class="b e" style="margin-top: 20px"><b>1.</b> What are some prayers that God has answered in your life?</div>
	<div class="b e"><b>2.</b> What are some of the things that you pray most earnestly for today?</div>
	<div class="d">ANTICIPATION</div>
	<div class="b">My personal hypothesis is that many Christians today have a deficiency not in hope fulfilled but in hope anticipated. To illustrate this hypothesis, I am going to pull from one of my all-time favorite sermons, one from C.S. Lewis, the transcript of which is now known as an essay titled “The Weight of Glory.”</div>
	<div class="b c f">[I]f we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that Our Lord finds our desires, not too strong, but too weak. We are halfhearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.</div>
	<div class="b c">I believe this harsh criticism of the Church applies just as much today as it did to Oxford Englishmen in 1942. Many of us (myself included) constantly forget how completely and utterly astounding the reality is that we are co-heirs with Christ to inherit God’s perfect and infinite New Creation. There are a litany of reasons for this, but I will highlight two in particular.</div>
	<div class="b c">The first is that some of us treat this promise as a platitude. Saying we are promised Heaven is the equivalent of saying “Jesus loves me.” We think to ourselves, “of course Jesus loves me. Doesn't everyone know that?”</div>
	<div class="b c">The second is a self-imposed unworthiness, the veil of shame over our deep imperfection that prevents us from truly accepting that eternal goodness is promised us.</div>
	<div class="g">REFLECTION</div>
	<div class="b e" style="margin-top: 20px"><b>1.</b> What are some things you know to be true about the Gospel in your head but can't quite feel the gravity of in your heart?</div>
	<div class="b e"><b>2.</b> What are some of the your deepest secrets that you hesitate to tell anyone? <i>(This one will not be shared in discussion time)</i></div>
	<div class="d">SOLUTION</div>
	<div class="b">Our boy C.S. Lewis doesn't leave us hanging, but does provide us an answer to how we can be bolder in our desires. As much as I love the original, I will give you a convenient summary in 21st century American English.</div>
	<div class="b c">It starts with a question. <i>Why is God making us wait?</i> Why couldn't God just fulfill everything through Jesus at the cross? Why are there 2,000 years and counting in the "already but not yet" kingdom?</div>
	<div class="b c">The answer is <b>idolatry</b>. At first thought, there may not seem to be much connection, but the New Covenant aims for the same goal that the Old Covenant did.</div>
	<div class="b c f">I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. (Exo 6:7, NIV)</div>
	<div class="b c">God delivers for the purpose of communion. The first step to communion is a sense of belonging. I will be yours, and you will be mine.</div>
	<div class="b c f">I will put my dwelling place among you, and I will not abhor you. I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people. (Lev 26:11-12, NIV)</div>
	<div class="b c">Communion is fulfilled when a sense of belonging is consummated with intimacy. The height of intimacy is uncomfortably close. After all, the Biblical analogies we're often given are "skin-to-skin" and "tongue-to-tongue." That's why friends are described as pieces of iron grinding each other and why we're often told to "taste and see" God's goodness. And, that is why it is important that God must "dwell" among us.</div>
	<div class="b c">So, what does this have to do with idolatry? Paul answers this for the New Covenant.</div>
	<div class="b c f">Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.” (2 Cor 6:14-16, NIV)</div>
	<div class="b c">This is now the final piece to the puzzle before the punchline. Why does Christ have a 2nd coming instead of just a 1st coming? It is because there is a fundamental difference between a "believer" and a "non-believer."</div>
	<div class="b c">Paul himself defines this difference in these very verses, <i>we are temples of the living God</i>. While that answer on its own suffices, here is one way to recognize the profundity of the fact that we are "dwelling places" for God.</div>
	<div class="b c">Have you ever thought to yourself, "God, if my ultimate destination is perfect eternity with you, why can't you just make it happen now?" Well, one part of the answer might surprise you. God is saving you from yourself.</div>
	<div class="b c">In Heaven, you will not be "you" in the sense we understand it now. You will be so incomprehensibly magnificent and glorious that even the faintest glimpse would make your body quake in awe. In other words, you would never be able to resist the urge to worship yourself.</div>
	<div class="b c">That right there is why Paul says there is nothing in common between a believer and a non-believer. A non-believer looks at—Wealth, Fame, Title, Beauty, Intelligence, Justice, the list goes on and on—all of the highest pursuits within the world we live in and chase after them as if nothing could be better. Yet, none of those things are even worth a drop in the vast ocean of God's glory.</div>
	<div class="b c">As believers, we are temples. We have God's grace in the form of intimate knowledge of himself through the impartation of his Spirit and the guarantee that this knowledge will never leave in a covenant bound by Christ's blood.</div>
	<div class="b c">That is why one day when our Lord returns. We will stare at the reflection of our heavenly bodies and see but a shadow of the glory of the one whose original image is reflected. We will resist the urge to worship ourselves because in this life we have already known someone greater.</div>
	<div class="d">CONCLUSION</div>
	<div class="b">My friends, there is no greater joy than to remember the cross. When Israel was in the Wilderness, God's counsel did not say to look forward to Canaan but to remember their deliverance from Egypt. The greatest way to recognize our greatest hope is to remember the greatest sacrifice that earned it for us.</div>
	<div class="b c">So, I wrote all these paragraphs to say something that another Paul said in a few sentences.</div>
	<div class="b c f">Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose. Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. So you too should be glad and rejoice with me. (Phil 2:12-18, NIV)</div>
