                        <h3>The Problem First-Hand</h3>
                        <p>Kimia, a 9th grader, was struggling with geometry. Although she got a B+ in Algebra I, her
                            grades dropped to a C- in geometry. Traditional tutoring sessions were expensive and didn‚Äôt
                            address her specific learning gaps. Her tutor helped her with her assignments and helped her
                            get through, but real mastery and confidence did not grow. She thought that she was bad at
                            math, not realizing that it just wasn‚Äôt taught to her at a pace and format that made sense
                            to her. That reduction of confidence and competence drastically impacted future math courses
                            because math is a compounding subject that, if lacking mastery on the fundamentals, becomes
                            exponentially harder.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="after">
                        <h3>What Made The Difference</h3>
                        <p>Fast forward, Kimia‚Äôs final transcript varied depending on how something was taught, but she
                            overcame the lie in her mind that she was not bright. Her mentors, select teachers, and
                            parents helped her regain the confidence she lost in the classroom. She even got her pilot‚Äôs
                            license and flew a plane by herself at the age of 17, despite getting a C- in Physics,
                            eventually demonstrating to herself that her grades did not define her capability. But
                            still, grades do matter when it comes to opening doors of opportunity, and more importantly,
                            she wanted to actually master academic concepts. That‚Äôs why over a decade later, Kimia and
                            her husband Paul are on a mission to help high school students feel competent and confident
                            so that they can see their potential for themselves.</p>
